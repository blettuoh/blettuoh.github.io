          <h1 id="Morrison">Robert Johnson</h1>
          <p class="more-bio">
            Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 – August 16, 1938) was an American blues<br>
            singer-songwriter and musician. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display<br>
            a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has<br>
            influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's poorly documented life<br>
            and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend. One Faustian myth says that<br>
            he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads of Mississippi highways to achieve success.<br>
            As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints,<br>
            and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public<br>
            recognition in his lifetime. After the reissue of his recordings in 1961,<br>
            on the LP King of the Delta Blues Singers, his work reached a wider audience.<br>
            Johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly of the Mississippi<br>
            Delta blues style. He is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence;<br>
            the blues and rock musician Eric Clapton has called Johnson<br>
            "the most important blues singer that ever lived." Johnson was inducted into the<br>
            Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early<br>
            influence on rock and roll. In 2003, David Fricke ranked Johnson fifth in Rolling Stone<br>
            magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            Richard James "Richey" Edwards (22 December 1967 – died c. 7 February 1995) was<br>
            a Welsh musician who was the lyricist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative<br>
            rock band Manic Street Preachers. He was known for his dark, politicised and<br>
            intellectual songwriting which, combined with an enigmatic and eloquent character,<br>
            has assured him cult status, as well as having been cited by some as a leading<br>
            lyricist of his generation. Edwards disappeared on 7 February 1995. On 24 November 2008,<br>
            it was announced that Edwards' parents had obtained a court order, issued by the Probate<br>
            Registry of Wales, naming them as executors of his estate and further stating that he died<br>
            "on or since" 1 February 1995. The ninth album by Manic Street Preachers,<br>
            Journal for Plague Lovers, released on 18 May 2009, is composed entirely of songs<br>
            with lyrics left behind by Edwards.[6] Up until 2005, the remaining members<br>
            of Manic Street Preachers still paid 25% royalties into an account in his name.<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            Janis Lyn Joplin (/ˈdʒɒplɪn/; January 19, 1943 – October 4, 1970) nicknamed<br>
            The Pearl, was an American rock, soul and blues singer and songwriter,<br>
            and one of the most successful and widely-known female rock stars of her era.<br>
            After releasing three albums, she died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27.<br>
            A fourth album, Pearl, was released in January 1971, just over three months after her death.<br>
            It reached number one on the Billboard charts. In 1967, Joplin rose to fame during<br>
            an appearance at Monterey Pop Festival, where she was the lead singer of the then<br>
            little-known San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company.<br>
            After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue<br>
            as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the Kozmic Blues Band<br>
            and then the Full Tilt Boogie Band. She appeared at the Woodstock festival<br>
            and the Festival Express train tour. Five singles by Joplin went into the Billboard Hot 100,<br>
            including a cover of the Roger Miller song "Me and Bobby McGee", which<br>
            reached number 1 in March 1971. Her most popular songs include her cover versions<br>
            of "Piece of My Heart", "Cry Baby", "Down on Me", "Ball and Chain", and "Summertime";<br>
            and her original song "Mercedes Benz", her final recording. Joplin, highly respected for<br>
            her charismatic performing ability, was posthumously inducted into<br>
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Audiences and critics alike referred<br>
            to her stage presence as "electric". Rolling Stone ranked Joplin number 46 on its 2004<br>
            list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and number 28 on its 2008 list<br>
            of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. She remains one of the top-selling musicians<br>
            in the United States, with Recording Industry Association of America<br>
            certifications of 15.5 million albums sold.<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones (28 February 1942 – 3 July 1969) was an English musician,<br>
            best known as founder and the original leader of the Rolling Stones.<br>
            Initially a slide guitarist, Jones would go on to play a wide variety of instruments<br>
            on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts, such as rhythm and lead guitar,<br>
            various keyboard instruments such as piano and organ, marimba, harmonica,<br>
            sitar, wind instruments such as recorder, saxophone, oboe, and numerous others.<br>
            Jones and fellow guitarist Keith Richards developed a unique style of guitar<br>
            play that Richards refers to as the "ancient art of weaving" where both players<br>
            would play both rhythm and lead parts together; Richards would carry the style<br>
            on with later Stones guitarists and the sound would become a Rolling Stones trademark.<br>
            A few years after he founded the Rolling Stones as a British blues outfit in 1962,<br>
            and gave the band its name, Jones' fellow band members Mick Jagger and<br>
            Keith Richards began to take over the band's musical direction, especially after<br>
            they became a successful songwriting team. Jones also did not get along with<br>
            the band's manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, who pushed the band into a musical<br>
            direction at odds with Jones's blues background. At the same time, Jones<br>
            developed a drug problem, and his performance in the studio became increasingly<br>
            unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he founded. The Rolling Stones<br>
            asked Jones to leave in June 1969 and guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group.<br>
            Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his<br>
            home while under the influence of drugs. Long-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist<br>
            Bill Wyman said of Jones, "He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band.<br>
            He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential,<br>
            very important, and then slowly lost it – highly intelligent – and just kind of wasted it<br>
            and blew it all away."<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 – 23 July 2011) was an English<br>
            singer and songwriter. She was known for her deep, expressive contralto<br>
            vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul (sometimes labelled<br>
            as blue-eyed soul and neo soul), rhythm and blues, and jazz. Winehouse's debut album,<br>
            Frank (2003), was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize.<br>
            Her follow-up album, Back to Black (2006), led to five 2008 Grammy Awards, tying<br>
            the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made<br>
            her the first British woman to win five Grammys, including three of the General<br>
            Field "Big Four" Grammy Awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year.<br>
            Winehouse won three Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters,<br>
            Composers, and Authors: in 2004, Best Contemporary Song for "Stronger Than Me"; in 2007,<br>
            Best Contemporary Song again, this time for "Rehab"; and in 2008, Best Song Musically and<br>
            Lyrically for "Love Is a Losing Game." She also won the 2007 Brit Award for Best<br>
            British Female Artist, having been nominated for Best British Album, with Back to Black.<br>
            Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011, at the age of 27.<br>
            Her album Back to Black posthumously became, for a time,<br>
            the UK's best-selling album of the 21st century.<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            James Douglas Morrison (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971) was an American<br>
            singer-songwriter, and poet, best remembered as the lead vocalist of the Doors.<br>
            Due to his poetic lyrics, distinctive voice, wild personality, performances,<br>
            and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison<br>
            is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential<br>
            frontmen in rock music history. Morrison co-founded the Doors during the summer<br>
            of 1965 in Venice, California. The band spent two years in obscurity until shooting<br>
            to prominence with their #1 single in the United States, "Light My Fire", taken from<br>
            their self-titled debut album. Morrison recorded a total of six studio albums with<br>
            the Doors, all of which sold well and received critical acclaim.Though the Doors<br>
            recorded two more albums after his death,the loss of Morrison was crippling to the band<br>
            and they disbanded in 1973. In 1993, Morrison, as a member of the Doors, was inducted into<br>
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

            "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".<br>
            Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age<br>
            of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper<br>
            in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year.<br>
            Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs<br>
            on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing<br>
            band and later with Little Richard. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before<br>
            moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested<br>
            bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months,<br>
            Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: "Hey Joe",<br>
            "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance<br>
            at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album,<br>
            Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially<br>
            successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid<br>
            performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival<br>
            in 1970, before his accidental death<br>
            from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.<br>

          <h1 id="Morrison">Kurt Cobain</h1>
          <p class="more-bio">
            Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – April 5, 1994) was an American singer,<br>
            songwriter, and musician. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band<br>
            Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as<br>
            part of the Seattle music scene which later became known as grunge. Nirvana's debut<br>
            album Bleach was released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.<br>
            After signing with major label DGC Records, Nirvana found success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit"<br>
            from their second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana<br>
            was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation."<br>
            Cobain, however, was uncomfortable with the label, believing his message and artistic<br>
            vision had been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal problems often subject<br>
            to media attention. During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction<br>
            and chronic health problems such as depression. He also had difficulty coping<br>
            with his fame and public image, and the professional and personal pressures surrounding<br>
            himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead<br>
            at his home in Seattle by a security-system installer; his death was ruled a suicide<br>
            by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. The circumstances of his death<br>
            at age 27 have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, Nirvana,<br>
            with Cobain as a songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the U.S., and over 75 million worldwide.<br>
            Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014,<br>
            along with Nirvana bandmates Dave Grohl and Novoselic, in their first year of eligibility.<br>
            They were inducted by the frontman of American alternative rock band R.E.M., Michael Stipe,<br>
            who was a close friend of Cobain.<br>

          <h1 id="Morrison">Ron McKernan</h1>
          <p class="more-bio">
            Ronald Charles McKernan (September 8, 1945 – March 8, 1973), known as Pigpen,<br>
            was an American singer and musician. He was a founding member of the<br>
            San Francisco band the Grateful Dead and played in the group from 1965 to 1972.<br>
            McKernan grew up heavily influenced by African-American music, particularly the blues,<br>
            and enjoyed listening to his father's collection of records and taught<br>
            himself how to play harmonica and piano. He began socializing around the<br>
            San Francisco Bay Area, becoming friends with Jerry Garcia. After the pair<br>
            had played in various folk and jug bands, McKernan suggested they form an electric group,<br>
            which became the Grateful Dead. He was the band's original frontman as well as<br>
            playing harmonica and electric organ, but Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh's<br>
            influences on the band became increasingly stronger as they embraced psychedelic rock.<br>
            McKernan struggled to keep up, causing the group to hire keyboardist Tom Constanten,<br>
            with McKernan's contributions essentially limited to vocals, harmonica and percussion<br>
            from November 1968 to January 1970. He continued to be a frontman in concert for some numbers,<br>
            including covers of Bobby Bland's "Turn On Your Love Light" and the Rascals' "Good Lovin'".<br>
            Unlike the other members of the Grateful Dead, McKernan avoided psychedelic drugs,<br>
            preferring to drink alcohol (namely whiskey and flavored fortified wine). By 1971,<br>
            his health had been affected by alcoholism and liver damage and doctors advised him<br>
            to stop touring. Following a four-month hiatus, he resumed touring with the group<br>
            in December 1971 but was forced to retire from touring altogether in June 1972.<br>
            McKernan was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage on<br>
            March 8, 1973, aged 27, and is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto.<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            Dennes Dale "D." Boon (April 1, 1958 – December 22, 1985) was an American singer,<br>
            songwriter, and guitarist. Boon was best known as the guitarist and vocalist<br>
            of the American punk rock trio Minutemen. In 1985 he was killed in a traffic<br>
            crash at the age of 27.Dennes Boon was born in San Pedro, California, on April 1, 1958.<br>
            His father, a navy veteran, worked installing radios in Buick cars, and<br>
            the Boons lived in former World War II barracks that had been converted into<br>
            public housing. As a teenager, Boon began painting and signed his works "D. Boon",<br>
            partly because "D" was his slang for cannabis, partly after Daniel Boone, but mostly<br>
            because it was similar to E. Bloom, Blue Öyster Cult's vocalist and guitarist.<br>
            Boon formed Minutemen in January 1980 with childhood friend Mike Watt on bass,<br>
            from their previous band, The Reactionaries, later adding former Reactionaries<br>
            drummer George Hurley. Their best known album was Double Nickels on the Dime.<br>
            The Minutemen continued until December 22, 1985, when Boon was killed in a van<br>
            accident in the Arizona desert on Interstate 10. Because he had been sick with fever,<br>
            Boon was lying down in the rear of the van without a seatbelt when the rear axle broken<br>
            and the van ran off the road. Boon was thrown out the back door of the van and died<br>
            instantly from a broken neck. He was 27 years old. The band immediately dissolved,<br>
            though Watt and Hurley would form the band Firehose soon after. The live album Ballot<br>
            Result was released in 1987, two years after Boon's death.<br>

          <p class="more-bio">
            Christopher Branford Bell (January 12, 1951 – December 27, 1978) was an<br>
            American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Along with Alex Chilton, he led<br>
            the power pop band Big Star through its first album #1 Record (1972).<br>
            He also pursued a solo career throughout the mid-1970s, resulting in the posthumous<br>
            I Am the Cosmos LP. All Music Guide praised Bell as "one of the unsung heroes<br>
            of American pop music" and noted his lasting impression, saying: "Despite a life<br>
            marked by tragedy and a career crippled by commercial indifference, the singer/songwriter's<br>
            slim body of recorded work proved massively influential on the generations of indie<br>
            rockers who emerged in his wake." His catalog of proto-alternative rock has<br>
            inspired the likes of Beck, R.E.M., Teenage Fanclub, Primal Scream, Afghan Whigs,<br>
            Pete Yorn, Wilco, The Posies, and The Replacements, all of which have covered his<br>
            music or name-dropped Big Star in the press. His life was documented in the acclaimed<br>
            Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me documentary, released in 2013 on Magnolia Pictures.<br>
            In the winter 2017, Bell's life will be documented in the book There Was a Light:<br>
            The Cosmic History of Chris Bell and the Rise of Big Star. The oral-history style bio<br>
            is slated for a November 2017 release.<br>
