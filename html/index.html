          <h1 id="Morrison">Robert Johnson</h1>
          <p class="more-bio">
            Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 – August 16, 1938) was an American blues
            singer-songwriter and musician. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display
            a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has
            influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's poorly documented life
            and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend. One Faustian myth says that
            he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads of Mississippi highways to achieve success.
            As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints,
            and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public
            recognition in his lifetime. After the reissue of his recordings in 1961,
            on the LP King of the Delta Blues Singers, his work reached a wider audience.
            Johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly of the Mississippi
            Delta blues style. He is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence;
            the blues and rock musician Eric Clapton has called Johnson
            "the most important blues singer that ever lived." Johnson was inducted into the
            Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early
            influence on rock and roll. In 2003, David Fricke ranked Johnson fifth in Rolling Stone
            magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

          <p class="more-bio">
            Richard James "Richey" Edwards (22 December 1967 – died c. 7 February 1995) was
            a Welsh musician who was the lyricist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative
            rock band Manic Street Preachers. He was known for his dark, politicised and
            intellectual songwriting which, combined with an enigmatic and eloquent character,
            has assured him cult status, as well as having been cited by some as a leading
            lyricist of his generation. Edwards disappeared on 7 February 1995. On 24 November 2008,
            it was announced that Edwards' parents had obtained a court order, issued by the Probate
            Registry of Wales, naming them as executors of his estate and further stating that he died
            "on or since" 1 February 1995. The ninth album by Manic Street Preachers,
            Journal for Plague Lovers, released on 18 May 2009, is composed entirely of songs
            with lyrics left behind by Edwards.[6] Up until 2005, the remaining members
            of Manic Street Preachers still paid 25% royalties into an account in his name.

          <p class="more-bio">
            Janis Lyn Joplin (/ˈdʒɒplɪn/; January 19, 1943 – October 4, 1970) nicknamed
            The Pearl, was an American rock, soul and blues singer and songwriter,
            and one of the most successful and widely-known female rock stars of her era.
            After releasing three albums, she died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27.
            A fourth album, Pearl, was released in January 1971, just over three months after her death.
            It reached number one on the Billboard charts. In 1967, Joplin rose to fame during
            an appearance at Monterey Pop Festival, where she was the lead singer of the then
            little-known San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company.
            After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue
            as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the Kozmic Blues Band
            and then the Full Tilt Boogie Band. She appeared at the Woodstock festival
            and the Festival Express train tour. Five singles by Joplin went into the Billboard Hot 100,
            including a cover of the Roger Miller song "Me and Bobby McGee", which
            reached number 1 in March 1971. Her most popular songs include her cover versions
            of "Piece of My Heart", "Cry Baby", "Down on Me", "Ball and Chain", and "Summertime";
            and her original song "Mercedes Benz", her final recording. Joplin, highly respected for
            her charismatic performing ability, was posthumously inducted into
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Audiences and critics alike referred
            to her stage presence as "electric". Rolling Stone ranked Joplin number 46 on its 2004
            list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and number 28 on its 2008 list
            of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. She remains one of the top-selling musicians
            in the United States, with Recording Industry Association of America
            certifications of 15.5 million albums sold.

          <p class="more-bio">
            Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones (28 February 1942 – 3 July 1969) was an English musician,
            best known as founder and the original leader of the Rolling Stones.
            Initially a slide guitarist, Jones would go on to play a wide variety of instruments
            on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts, such as rhythm and lead guitar,
            various keyboard instruments such as piano and organ, marimba, harmonica,
            sitar, wind instruments such as recorder, saxophone, oboe, and numerous others.
            Jones and fellow guitarist Keith Richards developed a unique style of guitar
            play that Richards refers to as the "ancient art of weaving" where both players
            would play both rhythm and lead parts together; Richards would carry the style
            on with later Stones guitarists and the sound would become a Rolling Stones trademark.
            A few years after he founded the Rolling Stones as a British blues outfit in 1962,
            and gave the band its name, Jones' fellow band members Mick Jagger and
            Keith Richards began to take over the band's musical direction, especially after
            they became a successful songwriting team. Jones also did not get along with
            the band's manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, who pushed the band into a musical
            direction at odds with Jones's blues background. At the same time, Jones
            developed a drug problem, and his performance in the studio became increasingly
            unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he founded. The Rolling Stones
            asked Jones to leave in June 1969 and guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group.
            Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his
            home while under the influence of drugs. Long-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist
            Bill Wyman said of Jones, "He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band.
            He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential,
            very important, and then slowly lost it – highly intelligent – and just kind of wasted it
            and blew it all away."

          <p class="more-bio">
            Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 – 23 July 2011) was an English
            singer and songwriter. She was known for her deep, expressive contralto
            vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul (sometimes labelled
            as blue-eyed soul and neo soul), rhythm and blues, and jazz. Winehouse's debut album,
            Frank (2003), was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize.
            Her follow-up album, Back to Black (2006), led to five 2008 Grammy Awards, tying
            the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made
            her the first British woman to win five Grammys, including three of the General
            Field "Big Four" Grammy Awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year.
            Winehouse won three Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters,
            Composers, and Authors: in 2004, Best Contemporary Song for "Stronger Than Me"; in 2007,
            Best Contemporary Song again, this time for "Rehab"; and in 2008, Best Song Musically and
            Lyrically for "Love Is a Losing Game." She also won the 2007 Brit Award for Best
            British Female Artist, having been nominated for Best British Album, with Back to Black.
            Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011, at the age of 27.
            Her album Back to Black posthumously became, for a time,
            the UK's best-selling album of the 21st century.

          <p class="more-bio">
            James Douglas Morrison (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971) was an American
            singer-songwriter, and poet, best remembered as the lead vocalist of the Doors.
            Due to his poetic lyrics, distinctive voice, wild personality, performances,
            and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison
            is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential
            frontmen in rock music history. Morrison co-founded the Doors during the summer
            of 1965 in Venice, California. The band spent two years in obscurity until shooting
            to prominence with their #1 single in the United States, "Light My Fire", taken from
            their self-titled debut album. Morrison recorded a total of six studio albums with
            the Doors, all of which sold well and received critical acclaim.Though the Doors
            recorded two more albums after his death,the loss of Morrison was crippling to the band
            and they disbanded in 1973. In 1993, Morrison, as a member of the Doors, was inducted into
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

          <p class="more-bio">
            James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix;
            November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer,
            and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years,
            he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists
            in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated
            musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as
            "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".
            Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age
            of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper
            in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year.
            Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs
            on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing
            band and later with Little Richard. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before
            moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested
            bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months,
            Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: "Hey Joe",
            "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance
            at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album,
            Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially
            successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid
            performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival
            in 1970, before his accidental death
            from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.

          <h1 id="Morrison">Kurt Cobain</h1>
          <p class="more-bio">
            Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – April 5, 1994) was an American singer,
            songwriter, and musician. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band
            Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as
            part of the Seattle music scene which later became known as grunge. Nirvana's debut
            album Bleach was released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.
            After signing with major label DGC Records, Nirvana found success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
            from their second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana
            was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation."
            Cobain, however, was uncomfortable with the label, believing his message and artistic
            vision had been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal problems often subject
            to media attention. During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction
            and chronic health problems such as depression. He also had difficulty coping
            with his fame and public image, and the professional and personal pressures surrounding
            himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead
            at his home in Seattle by a security-system installer; his death was ruled a suicide
            by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. The circumstances of his death
            at age 27 have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, Nirvana,
            with Cobain as a songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the U.S., and over 75 million worldwide.
            Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014,
            along with Nirvana bandmates Dave Grohl and Novoselic, in their first year of eligibility.
            They were inducted by the frontman of American alternative rock band R.E.M., Michael Stipe,
            who was a close friend of Cobain.

          <p class="more-bio">
            Ronald Charles McKernan (September 8, 1945 – March 8, 1973), known as Pigpen,
            was an American singer and musician. He was a founding member of the
            San Francisco band the Grateful Dead and played in the group from 1965 to 1972.
            McKernan grew up heavily influenced by African-American music, particularly the blues,
            and enjoyed listening to his father's collection of records and taught
            himself how to play harmonica and piano. He began socializing around the
            San Francisco Bay Area, becoming friends with Jerry Garcia. After the pair
            had played in various folk and jug bands, McKernan suggested they form an electric group,
            which became the Grateful Dead. He was the band's original frontman as well as
            playing harmonica and electric organ, but Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh's
            influences on the band became increasingly stronger as they embraced psychedelic rock.
            McKernan struggled to keep up, causing the group to hire keyboardist Tom Constanten,
            with McKernan's contributions essentially limited to vocals, harmonica and percussion
            from November 1968 to January 1970. He continued to be a frontman in concert for some numbers,
            including covers of Bobby Bland's "Turn On Your Love Light" and the Rascals' "Good Lovin'".
            Unlike the other members of the Grateful Dead, McKernan avoided psychedelic drugs,
            preferring to drink alcohol (namely whiskey and flavored fortified wine). By 1971,
            his health had been affected by alcoholism and liver damage and doctors advised him
            to stop touring. Following a four-month hiatus, he resumed touring with the group
            in December 1971 but was forced to retire from touring altogether in June 1972.
            McKernan was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage on
            March 8, 1973, aged 27, and is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto.

          <p class="more-bio">
            Dennes Dale "D." Boon (April 1, 1958 – December 22, 1985) was an American singer,
            songwriter, and guitarist. Boon was best known as the guitarist and vocalist
            of the American punk rock trio Minutemen. In 1985 he was killed in a traffic
            crash at the age of 27.Dennes Boon was born in San Pedro, California, on April 1, 1958.
            His father, a navy veteran, worked installing radios in Buick cars, and
            the Boons lived in former World War II barracks that had been converted into
            public housing. As a teenager, Boon began painting and signed his works "D. Boon",
            partly because "D" was his slang for cannabis, partly after Daniel Boone, but mostly
            because it was similar to E. Bloom, Blue Öyster Cult's vocalist and guitarist.
            Boon formed Minutemen in January 1980 with childhood friend Mike Watt on bass,
            from their previous band, The Reactionaries, later adding former Reactionaries
            drummer George Hurley. Their best known album was Double Nickels on the Dime.
            The Minutemen continued until December 22, 1985, when Boon was killed in a van
            accident in the Arizona desert on Interstate 10. Because he had been sick with fever,
            Boon was lying down in the rear of the van without a seatbelt when the rear axle broken
            and the van ran off the road. Boon was thrown out the back door of the van and died
            instantly from a broken neck. He was 27 years old. The band immediately dissolved,
            though Watt and Hurley would form the band Firehose soon after. The live album Ballot
            Result was released in 1987, two years after Boon's death.

          <p class="more-bio">
            Christopher Branford Bell (January 12, 1951 – December 27, 1978) was an
            American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Along with Alex Chilton, he led
            the power pop band Big Star through its first album #1 Record (1972).
            He also pursued a solo career throughout the mid-1970s, resulting in the posthumous
            I Am the Cosmos LP. All Music Guide praised Bell as "one of the unsung heroes
            of American pop music" and noted his lasting impression, saying: "Despite a life
            marked by tragedy and a career crippled by commercial indifference, the singer/songwriter's
            slim body of recorded work proved massively influential on the generations of indie
            rockers who emerged in his wake." His catalog of proto-alternative rock has
            inspired the likes of Beck, R.E.M., Teenage Fanclub, Primal Scream, Afghan Whigs,
            Pete Yorn, Wilco, The Posies, and The Replacements, all of which have covered his
            music or name-dropped Big Star in the press. His life was documented in the acclaimed
            Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me documentary, released in 2013 on Magnolia Pictures.
            In the winter 2017, Bell's life will be documented in the book There Was a Light:
            The Cosmic History of Chris Bell and the Rise of Big Star. The oral-history style bio
            is slated for a November 2017 release.
